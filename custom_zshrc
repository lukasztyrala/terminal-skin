# Custom prompt
# %% is "%"
# %) is ")"
# %n is a username
# %m, %M are machine host names
# %# is a shell state. When it returs "#" it means running with privileges, and "%" means without. Often instead of sell state it is nice to end prompt with "$". Remember to put " " (space) after the last PROMPT element.
# %? is a status of last command
# %d or %/ or %~ is working directory. Integers specify trailing components; negative ones specify leading components; 0 means full path. The ~ option replaces $HOME with ~.
# %D is yy-mm-dd, %T is time of day (24h) and %* includes seconds, %t or %@ for 12h format, %w is day-dd, %W is mm/dd/yy, and %D{strftime} allows to specify custom format
# %B%b starts and stops bold, %F{number_or_name}%f starts and stops character color, %K{}%k is for background, %U%u is underline and %S%s is standout
